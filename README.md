# Flower
Flower is a short and sweet library app to give an example of how the openlibrary api can be used. Search up your favourite books and bookmark them to read later. View them on goodreads or check them out on openlibrary.

## Dependencies
Flower relies on the openlibrary api and Sharks-Interactive's vanilla js Simple-Components library
